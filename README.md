# Personal Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio! This project acts as a means of displaying my skills and current projects to the world and to also practice and learn new concepts in Web design! This project uses HTML, JS and SASS. No front-end framework business just yet since I wanted to really learn and hone my Vanilla JS skillz.

## Getting Started
The source can be retrieved from Github.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/stephendpmurphy/portfolio.git
```

To begin, we need to first install the project Node dependencies.
```bash
$ npm install
```

Once we have our dependencies, we can serve up the web page on local host. This command will also watch all of the source files for any changes and exectue a live-reload as they are made!
```bash
$ npm start
```
